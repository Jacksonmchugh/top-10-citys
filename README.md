## Getting Started. 
#### When you first load the site it will take you to a home page. From the home page you can use the navigation bar to take you to the cities page, which will render the cities that have been entered. From the cities page you can select a single city and it will take you to a details page. Using the navigation bar you can go the city form page where you can add a city of your choice. You can then add a comment to a city from the city details page. The comments will render for each city on the city detail page.
